### Today: 

- Mutability
- Arrays





### Announcements 🐫

- MS0 due Thursday (no extensions!)
- tomorrow is ✨ break day! ✨
  * we are done with 6 weeks of the semester, 6 left
  * please take a break tomorrow!
  * no OH or consulting hours











It's a dark and stormy day in 3110












## Refs

a ref is a location in memory

**syntax**

```ocaml

(* create a ref x
 * val x : int ref *)
let x = ref 3110

(* return the contents of the ref *)
let val = !x

(* store the value 42 into the ref a
 * this expression has type unit *)
x := 42

```




**example:**

```ocaml

(* val counter : int ref *)
let counter = ref 0

(* val next_val : unit -> int *)
let next_val () = 
  counter := (!counter) + 1;
  !counter

```


















*exercise: sub* 


```ocaml

(* val next_val : unit -> int *)
let next_val () = 
  counter := (!counter) + 1;
  !counter

(* val (-=) : int ref -> int -> int 
 * subtracts y to x and returns the
 * value stored at x *)
let (-=) x y = 
  x := (!x) - y; !x

(* val (^=) : 
 *   string ref -> string -> string
 * concats y on to x and returns the
 * string stored at x *)
let (^=) x y = 
  x := (!x) ^ y; !x

```










## Mutable Fields

a record can have a mutable field, meaning their
contents can be updated w/o constructing new record

use `mutable` keyword


**syntax:**

```ocaml

type kitten = {
  name: string; 
  color: string;
  mutable cuteness: int;
}

let sprinkles = {
  name = "sprinkles";
  color = "black";
  cuteness = 2500;
}

(* kittens get less cute with age 
 * what do you get with this command? *)
sprinkles.cuteness <- 2000



(* okay but what happens if you try to run this? *)
sprinkles.name <- "snowbell"

```



`<-` is very similar to `:=` 
  but with record fields








## refs (revisited)

refs are just records with a single mutable field

```ocaml
type 'a ref = {mutable contents : 'a}
let ref x = {contents = x}
let (!) r = r.contents
let (:=) r newval = r.contents <- newval
```








## Equality

what is `(=)` mean??



`(==)` is the physical equality operator
it checks if 2 mutable values point to same location in memory

complement is `(!=)` for physically not equal



regular equality operators `(=)` and `(<>)` check contents






### ~ thoughts ~

* is it possible for `(=)` to return true and `(==)` to return false?
* is it possible for `(=)` to return false and `(==)` to return true?







try this out in utop!

```ocaml

let z = ref "wowie"
let x = z
x == z
z := "2b || !2b"
x
z
```





 





## Aliasing

* when two pointers point to same location in memory
* familiar from Java and other ~ imperative ~ languages

* hard to keep track of! yikes















## Arrays

* fixed-length mutable sequences with constant-time access and update
* kind of like tuples of refs!



**syntax:**

```ocaml

(* val arr : int array *)
let arr = [|1, 2, 3, 4, 5|]

(* array assignment (type = unit) *)
arr.(0) <- 0

(* array access *)
let five = arr.(4)

```



The `Array` module has very useful 
functions on arrays











*exercise: counter*

creating counters using a single ref



what's wrong w/ this implementation?

```ocaml
(** What's wrong with this implementation? *)
let counter () =
  let state = ref 0 in
  let next = !state in
  state := !state + 1;
  !state
```



can we do better and implement a correct counter?

```ocaml
(** Implement a counter that correctly maintains state *)
let counter =
  let state = ref 0 in 
  fun () -> 
    state := !state + 1;
    !state
```






*exercise: mutable list*

This is tricky one. 

we want to create a mutable linked 
list that allows us to replace nodes

let's go with a singly linked list
to start, come up with the right type

```ocaml

type 'a linked_list = {
  mutable root: 'a node option;
}

and 'a node = {
  value: 'a;
  mutable next: 'a node option;
}


(* Part 1: *)

(* Q: Why does this have to take in unit?
 * What happens if we remove the unit argument? *)
let empty () =
  failwith "Unimplemented"


(* Part 2: *)

let push (e: 'a) (l: 'a linked_list) : unit =
  failwith "Unimplemented"


(* Part 3: *)

let pop (l: 'a linked_list) : 'a option =
  failwith "Unimplemented"


(* Part 4: *)

let len (l: 'a linked_list) : int =
  failwith "Unimplemented"

```













## If time:

What has it been like to program 
functionally for the last two months?

What have the challenges been?

How have you come to think differently
about mutable state?
