### quick testing review

**black-box testing**

tests written only looking at the specification
* ignores implementation 
* works better when there are changes to implementation


**glass box testing**

tests for different execution paths throughout the code you are testing
* actually looking at code
* execution paths = all possible different branches










### abstractions

*modules*: provide encapsulation and abstraction:



**specifying data abstractions:**

what the client sees:

```ocaml
module type Set = sig 

  type 'a t
  val empty : 'a t
  val size : 'a t -> int
  val mem : 'a -> 'a t -> bool
  val add : 'a -> 'a t -> 'a t

end
```




implementation can't be accessed outside module:

```ocaml

module ListSet : Set = struct 

  type 'a t = 'a list 
  let empty = []
  let size = List.length
  let mem = List.mem
  let add x s = if mem x s then s else x :: s

end
```



client 			| implementation
-----------------------------------
|{1, 2, 4}| = 3	| size [1;2;4] --> 3
3 in {3, 1}		| mem 3 [3; 1] --> true
nil				| empty --> []











### abstraction functions
a 'function' from concrete data items to abstract data they represent

implementation --> abstract data

*example*:
list of integers --> set of naturals
				 --> stack of numbers


[1;2;3]	--> {2, 3, 1}
		--> | 2 |
			| 3 |
			| 1 |


abstraction function tells us **exactly** what the concrete value represents


example:

```ocaml

module ListSetNoDups : Set = struct 
  (* Abstraction function: the list
   * [a1; a2; ... an] that contains 
   * no duplicates represents the 
   * set containing all elements 
   * a1, a2, ... an
   * empty list represents empty set
   *)
  type 'a set = 'a list
  ...
end

```











### representation invariant:

defines which concrete values are valid abstract data items

* very closely related to _class invariants_ you saw in 2110
* RI is fact whose truth is invariant (like loop invariants)
* operations may violate it temporarily


RI must hold before and after concrete operation



[2;3;1] 	--> \ 
				 {2, 3, 1}
[3;1;2] 	--> /

[3;1;2;1]	--> not valid



documenting representations, put rep invariant next to abstraction fun.




```ocaml

module ListSetNoDups : Set = struct 
  (* Abstraction function: the list
   * [a1; a2; ... an] that contains 
   * no duplicates represents the 
   * set containing all elements 
   * a1, a2, ... an
   * empty list represents empty set
   * 
   * Representation invariant:
   * 
   *)
  type 'a set = 'a list
  ...
end
```



`rep_ok`: function in module that checks representation invariant. 
if RI fails then raise exception; otherwise return concrete value.

`val rep_ok : t -> t`










### correctness of operations

implementation is correct if AF commutes


`op_a( AF(c) ) = AF( op_c(c) )`


   	(concrete)
c 	-- op --> 	c'
|				|
AF 				AF
|				|
a 	-- op --> 	a'
	(abstract)

commutative if both paths lead to same place: 





**abstraction function** interpret representation type as data abs

**representation invariant** which values of representatin type are valid/meaningful











### practice~ *

```ocaml
module type MyMap = sig

  (* [('k,'v) t] is the type of a map
   * containing bindings from keys of
   * type ['k] to values of type ['v]. 
   *)
  type ('k,'v) t
  
  (* [empty] is the map containing no 
   * bindings. *)
  val empty : ('k,'v) t
  
  (* [mem k m] is true if [k] is bound 
   * in [m] and false otherwise. *)
  val mem : 'k -> ('k,'v) t -> bool
  
  (* [find k m] is [v] iff [k] is 
   * bound to [v] in [m]. 
   * raises: [Not_found] if [k] is not 
   * bound in [m]. *)
  val find : 'k -> ('k,'v) t -> 'v
  
  (* [add k v m] is the map [m'] that
   * contains the same bindings
   * as [m], and additionally binds 
   * [k] to [v]. If [k] was
   * already bound in [m], its old 
   * binding is replaced by the new 
   * binding in [m']. *)
  val add : 'k -> 'v -> ('k,'v) t -> ('k,'v) t
  
  (* [remove k m] is the map [m'] that 
   * contains the same bindings as 
   * [m], except that [k] is unbound 
   * in [m']. *)
  val remove : 'k -> ('k,'v) t -> ('k,'v) t

end 
```



*1)*, write AF + RI for each module (assoc list)

*2)* implement both modules

*3)* implement `FnMap`

*4)* implement `rep_ok` for all


```ocaml 
module ListMapDups = struct

  (* AF: 
   * RI: 
   *)
  type ('k,'v) t = ...
  
  let empty = failwith "implement me!"
  
  let mem k m = failwith "implement me!"
      
  let find = failwith "implement me!"
  
  let add k v m = failwith "implement me!"
    
  let remove k m = failwith "implement me!"

  let rep_ok m = failwith "implement me!"

end

module ListMapNoDups = struct

  (* AF: 
   * RI: 
   *)
  type ('k,'v) t = ...
  
  let empty = failwith "implement me!"
  
  let mem k m = failwith "implement me!"
      
  let find = failwith "implement me!"
  
  let add k v m = failwith "implement me!"
    
  let remove k m = failwith "implement me!"

  let rep_ok m = failwith "implement me!"

end

module FnMap = struct

  (* AF: The function [f] represents a map that binds [k] to [v] 
   *   iff [f k] is [v]. If [k] is unbound in the map then [f k]
   *   raises [Not_found].
   * RI: <fill this in>
   *)
  type ('k,'v) t = 'k -> 'v
  
  let empty = failwith "implement me!"
  
  let mem k m = failwith "implement me!"
      
  let find = failwith "implement me!"
  
  let add k v m = failwith "implement me!"
    
  let remove k m = failwith "implement me!"

  let rep_ok m = failwith "implement me!"

end
```
