dis #227



## Today: 
✨introductions!  
✨logistics + what to expect from discussion  
✨questions?  
✨discuss lab 01  


### who am I?
- 4th year CS major
- took CS 3110 spring 2018
- hobbies / interests:  
  🧠 brain stuff (puzzles, crosswords, trivia)  
  🎨 embroidery  
  🌱 hiking
- dislikes: being sleep deprived, getting rick rolled


### who are you?
name, major, last language you've used



### what to expect from *this* section?
small group help with course material

goals of discussion:
- improve your understanding of *content* of course through problem solving sessions 
- give you hands on practice with questions
- (hopefully) provide different perspectives on how to solve problems


- participate
- ask questions
- work together

recitation is **not** required
- come if you want :)


### logistics
*email*: ady8@cornell.edu  
*campuswire*: #dis227  
*OH*: tbd  



### making the most out of 3110
- 3110 is about **~problem solving~** 
- why functional programming?
  - change the way you think about programming
  - write code cleanly + concisely
- the language (ocaml) is just a tool to get there

- try things on your own, but study in  ~ groups ~
- ask conceptual questions during office hours
- keep an open mind
- take breaks, and keep a life outside of 3110 (don't get sleep deprived)


### any questions??



---



### OMM questions

- differentiating b/w functional + imperative programming

- how to use ocaml

- `let` expression + scoping

- does the top level allow mutability ???? what???



---



## some kinds of expressions

**primitive operators**  
+, *, /  
`||`


**function application**  
`int_of_string "3110"`  
`max (-4) 2`  
`print_endline "3110 is cool!!"`



### if expressions
**syntax**  
`if b then e1 else e2`


**type checking**  
if `b` has type `bool`, `e1` has type `t`, and `e2` has type `t`...  
then,  
`if b then e1 else e2` has type `t`


what is `t`???  
represents any OCaml type

*note*: the type of `e1` and `e2` have to be *the same*


**evaluation**  
if `b` ==> `true`, and `e1` ==> `v`,  
`if b then e1 else e2` ==> `v`

if `b` ==> `false`, and `e2` ==> `v`,  
`if b then e1 else e2` ==> `v`



### let expressions

**syntax**

```ocaml
 let x = e1 in e2
```

`x` = identifier  
`e1` = binding expression  
`e2` = body



**static semantics**  
if `e1` has type `t1`,  
and assuming `x` has type `t1`, `e2` has type `t2`    
then `let x = e1 in e2` has type `t2`



**evaluation**

```ocaml
let x = e1 in e2
```

evaluate `e1` to value `v1`  
substitute `v1` for `x` in `e2`, which gives us `e2'`  
evaluate `e2'` to `v2`  

then result of evaluation is `v2`



**example**:
`let x = 310 + 1 in x * 10`

1) what's the type of this expression?? 


```ocaml
let x = 310 + 1 
  in x * 10

  ==>

let x = 311
  in x * 10

  ==>


let x = 311 
  in 311 * 10

  ==>


let x = 311 
  in 3110

==>

3110

```


why won't this compile?

```ocaml
let x = 5 in let y = 10 in y || x
```


---


### scope

**scope** of a variable is where its name is meaningful

`let x = e1 in e2`  
                ^
           where the `x` 
           is in scope


```ocaml
let x = 42 in 
  let y = 1 in
    x * y
```
x is bound to 42 after the first `in`  
y is bound to 1 after the second `in`



### overlapping scope
```ocaml
let x = 5 in
  (let x = 6 in x) + x
```


what???

*principle of name irrelevance*: 
name of a variable shouldn't intrinsically matter


this is actually equivalent to

```ocaml
let x = 5 in 
  (let y = 6 in y) + x
```



```ocaml
let x = 5 in
  (let x = 6 in x) + x

=> 

let x = 5 in
  (let x = 6 in 6) + x

=>

let x = 5 in
  6 + x

=>

let x = 5 in
  6+5

etc.
```



stop substituting when you reach a new binding of the same variable name

nested assignment: called *shadowing*  
*shadowing*: the new binding of a variable temporarily casts a *shadow* over the old one



**what about utop???**  
it's really nested scopes

so 

```ocaml
let x = 1;;

let x = 2;;

x;;
```


really means

```ocaml
let x = 1 in

  let x = 2 in 

    x
```

## lab time

try:  
(4) Write an expression that evaluates to `"OOP and FP are equally fun"` if 2110 is (structurally) equal to 3110, and `"OOP and FP are not equally fun"` otherwise.

(5) Write a *top-level definition* that defines an identifier `my_var` and assigns it the value 42.

(7) Write the type of the expression below, or state that it is not well-typed and explain why.
```ocaml
if 0 then "hello" else "goodbye"
```

(13) Determine what the following expression evaluates to. Figure out the answer on your own, but feel free to double check with utop.

```ocaml
let x = 5 in (let x = x + 6 in string_of_int x) ^ (if x > 10 then "abc" else "xyz")
```
