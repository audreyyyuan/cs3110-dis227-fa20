Audrey Yuan: ady8@cornell.edu

discussion #227








### Today: 

- Variants
- Higher-order functions



**Announcements**

- A0 grades are out!
- A1 due Sunday 11:59PM
- submit feedback form! closes wednesday



some general feedback:

3110 uses a lot of abstractions; please try to keep your specifications as abstract as possible
use the typechecker for hints / help on this

```ocaml
let is_cool course = 
  if course = "3110" then true else false
```
is the same as

```ocaml
let is_cool course = 
  course = "3110"
```


**logistical questions??**

















### variants

new data type

kinda like enums in java.... 

**syntax**:

`type t = C1 | ... | Cn`



each `Ci` is a constructor
* a constructor is a value
* has type `t`
* name is a pattern





ex: 

```ocaml

type color = Brown | Pink | Fuschia


(* val is_happy_color : color -> bool 
 * returns true if `c` is a happy
 * color, false otherwise *)
let is_happy_color c = 
  match c with
  | Brown -> false
  | Pink | Fuchsia -> true
```










so.... we can't always make assumptions

need some way of expressing things when there 'might not' be a return value
- ex: 2nd element of a list, but what if length of list = 1???

something better than `null`....




options to the rescue!!

`type option = None | Some 'a`

 returning `'a option` instead of `'a`
 gives us the option to return nothing

 a lil way to get around the type requirements of OCaml


 ```ocaml
let safe_hd lst = 
  match lst with 
  | [] -> None 
  | h::_ -> Some h
 ```











### variants with fields

variants can have type fields!

`type t = C1 of t1 | C2 of t2`



ex: shapes

```ocaml

type point  = float * float

type shape =
  | Point  of point
  | Circle of point * float 
            (* center and radius *)
  | Rect   of point * point 
          (* lower-left and 
              upper-right corners *)

```









### recursive variants

variant types may mention their own
name inside their own body!


This allows us to build cool recursive 
types - like lists!



example:

```ocaml
type int_list = 
  | Nil 
  | Cons of int * int_list

```









### polymorphic variants

but that list above only works for 
`int`s...
we have to create something new for string_list, 
int_list, etc.
why can't we just make some things work for 
~ all ~ types??



abstraction!!!

variant types can be *parametrized* on other types!




**example: list to end all lists:**

a list type that can contain any type of element
then, define a length function for it


```ocaml

type 'a superlist = 
  | Nil 
  | Cons of 'a * ('a superlist)

```





so options are actually polymorphic variants!

Today we are going higher order




with the prettiest type of them all^:
[^stolen from sp18 notes]






              `x -> y`














           \ /         \ /
            X    ==>    | 
           / \          |













what are the types of these?

```ocaml
let add a b = a + b
add : int -> int -> int

let add_five = add 5
add_five : int -> int

```




what about this?

```ocaml
let apply_twice f x = f (f x)
apply_twice : ('a -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'a

```




functions are values!!

we can pass them around!!

we can partially apply them to create new functions!!!

wow cool!!









### Filter 

```ocaml
val List.filter : 
  ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list
```

we take a function (predicate) as input and apply it 
to every element of the list...

if the function returns true / element satisfies predicate, 
we keep the element. otherwise we throw it away.

*example:*

```ocaml

(* evens : int list -> int list
 * [evens lst] returns a new list containing
 * only the even numbers from [lst] *)
let evens lst = 
  List.filter (fun x -> x mod 2 = 0) lst

# evens [1;2;3;4;5;6;7];;
[2;4;6]

```












### Fold

```ocaml
val List.fold_left : 
('a -> 'b -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'b list -> 'a
```

`fold_left f init lst`

`f`: a function that takes an 
	 accumulator value, a value, 
	 and returns a new accumulator value
`init`: starting accumulator value
`lst`: some list




We apply `f` to every element of `lst`
one at a time and build up `acc`






so it's like an assembly line where the first worker builds something, gives it to the next worker, and each worker uses each element of the input to build one big thing










`List.fold_left` applies `f` 
from left to right


`List.fold_right` also exists....
which applies `f` from right to left




`List.fold_right` IS NOT tail recursive
but `List.fold_left` IS tail recursive






the syntax difference between the two is super confusing

`List.fold_left`:
`('a -> 'b -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'b list -> 'a`
parameters: fold_left f init lst
f : acc -> x -> result (`'a -> 'b -> 'a`)


`List.fold_right`:
`('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b`
parameters: fold_right f lst init
f : x -> acc -> result (`'a -> 'b -> 'b`)








### lab time!!

breakout room 1: q2, q3, q17, q20

breakout room 2: q7, q8, q14, q15


9, 10, 21, 23








if time:
finish superlist

```ocaml
(* val len : 'a superlist -> int  
 * returns the number of elements 
 * in `lst` *)
let len lst = ...

```


implement `List.map`

```ocaml
(* 
val map : 
('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list
*)
let rec map f lst = 
  match lst with 
  | [] -> []
  | h::t -> (f h)::(map f t)

```


implement `List.fold_right`

```ocaml
(* 
val fold_right : 
('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b -> 'b
*)
let rec fold_right f lst init = 
  match lst with 
  | [] -> init
  | h::t -> f h (fold_right f t init)

```
