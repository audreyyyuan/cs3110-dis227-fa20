### OMM questions

- types within function body + argument types
- ~functions~ (5)
- lists (4)
- tail recursion (3)
- records (3)
- pattern matching (3)
- anonymous functions (2)
- tuples (1)



`let f (x:int) : int = x + 1`











### lists


**list syntax**

`[]`	nil
`::`	cons

ex: `10::20::30::[]`
	`"the"::"lazy"::"fox"::[]`











**syntactic sugar for lists**

`1::2::3::[]` is _syntactically_ equivalent to `[1;2;3]`


we will usually use the sugared syntax irl when dealing with list primitives






**intuition for lists in OCaml**

like linkedlists in java!
- really 2 operations: 
  - `push` and `pop`
- actually pretty powerful!


Java-esque			OCaml
`lst.push(a)`	=   `a::lst`
`lst.pop()`		=   `match lst with h::_ -> h`
















### tuples!

many pieces of data glued together  
like vectors! (or a giant coordinate pair)

used for specific number of data in a specific order


**syntax**
`(e1, e2, ... en)`

**types**
`val (e1, e2, e3) : t1 * t2 * t3`
if
`e1 : t1`, `e2 : t2`, `e3 : t3`


```ocaml

# let coords = (40.7128, -74.0060);;
```


try to keep your tuples at length 3  
probably should use a different data structure if you need more











### records

more data glued together
a composite type made of other types!!

each *record* contains *fields* with names


**syntax**

must define record type _before_ use!!

```ocaml

type school = {
	name : string;
	population : int;
	zip_code: int
}

```


to create a record:

```ocaml

let cornell = {
	name = "Cornell";
	population = 21904;
	zip_code = 14850
}


# cornell.name;;
- : string = "Cornell"

```











### pattern matching

match based on the structure of data
extract part(s) of data



**syntax**

```ocaml

match e with 
| p1  -> e1
| p2  -> e2
| ... -> ...
| pn  -> en

```


kinda like a switch statement....
but more powerful!





```ocaml

let is_empty lst = 
  match lst with 
  | [] -> true
  | _  -> false

```







**list syntax**

`[]`		   empty list

`h::t`		   list with at least one
			   element
			    -> binds `h` to the first element
			    -> binds `t` to the rest of the list



**deep pattern matching**

`a::[]`        matches lists with 
               exactly *1* element

`a::b::[]`     matches lists with 
               exactly *2* elements

`a::b::c::[]`  matches lists with 
               exactly *3* elements

`a::b::c::d`   matches lists with 
               *at least 3* elements

and so on...



can you do `a::a::[]`???
no :)







**tuples**
`(a, b, c)`

ex:

```ocaml

type person = string * int

match ("bob", 90) with 
| (x, 90) -> x ^ " has an A"
| _ -> "dude does not have an A"

```









**records**


```ocaml

type school = {
	name : string;
	population : int;
	zip_code: int
}

let cornell = {
	name = "Cornell";
	population = 21904;
	zip_code = 14850
}


  match cornell with 
  | {name="harvard"} -> "this is harvard"
  | {name=x} -> x

```







**pattern matching exercises!**

```ocaml

(* val second : int list -> int *)
(* gets second element of list, assume list 
   has more than 2  elements*)
let rec second lst = 
  match lst with 
  | a::b::_ -> b


(* val sum : int list -> int *)
(* sum of all elements in the list *)
let rec sum lst = 
  failwith "unimplemented"


(* val map : int list -> (int -> int) -> int list *)
(* applies f to all elemets of lst *)
let rec map lst f = 
  failwith "unimplemented"


```





some ways this can go wrong:

- non-exhaustive pattern matching

```ocaml
match lst with
| [] -> "ack!"
```


- unused branches (warning)

```ocaml
match lst with
| h::t -> true
| [h]  -> false
| []   -> true
```












### anonymous functions 🐭

**syntax**:

`fun x1 ... xn -> e`


- `x1 ... xn` = function arguments
- `e` 		  = function body


- functions are  ~ values ~
  * assign functions to identifiers 
  * functions can have *other* functions in as inputs
  * functions can output / return functions











### partial application

surprise~ ! 😮

functions in ocaml don't *actually* have multiple arguments  
technically multiple nested functions, each with a single argument


```ocaml

let add x y = x + y

(* is actually....*)

let add = fun x -> fun y -> x + y
int -> int -> int


let partially_applied = add 3
int -> int
fun y -> 3 + y


partially_applied 10
13 : int

```



okay, that's cool and all, but now what???


we can build functions like this!!

```ocaml

let add5 = add 5 (*what??! 🤯*)


# add5 37;;
- : int = 42


```











### ~ ~ Tail Recursion ~ ~



How much time and space does this take?

```ocaml
let rec sum lst =
  match lst with
  | []   -> 0
  | h::t -> h + (sum t)
```


can we do better?








```ocaml
let rec sum_plus_acc acc lst =
  match lst with
  | []   -> acc
  | h::t -> sum_plus_acc (acc + h) t

let sum_tr lst = sum_plus_acc 0 lst
```

What's the space complexity now?








A function is *tail recursive* if it:
- calls itself recursively but does
  not perform any computation after the recursive call returns 
- immediately returns to its caller
  the value of its recursive call


in short: if last thing `f` does is call itself, it's tail recursive.










This is important because we only have so much stack space...

Let's examine how this can mess us up!

try this out in UTOP:

```ocaml

(* val lst_gen : 'a -> int -> 'a list 
 * generates a list of value `v` 
 * repeated `c` times *)
let lst_gen v c = 
  let rec h lst = function
    | 0 -> lst
    | c -> h (v::lst) (c-1) in
  h [] c

let lst = lst_gen 1 999999

let a = sum lst

let b = sum_tr lst
```






**exercise: tail recursion**

can we implement rev tail recursively?

```ocaml

let rec rev_helper lst acc =
  ...

(* val rev : 'a list -> 'a list  *)
let rev lst = 
  ...

```

hint: we can use a helper function



~ tail recursion ~ is awesome and should be used as often as possible

### exercise: gradebook

We don't have hashmaps in OCaml...

one data structure for key-value maps
is an association list! (list of tuples)

`[("jim", 5); ("nancy", 9); ...]`


Let's implement functions to work with
a simple association list gradebook


```ocaml
type gradebook = (string * int) list

(* Let's do the first one together *)

(* returns the integer grade
 * for `student` in gradebook `gb` 
 * assume `student` is in the gradebook
 *)
let rec get_grade gb student = 
  failwith "unimplemented"

(* adds an entry for `student`
 * with score `grade` and returns
 * the updated gradebook. *)
let add_grade gb student grade = 
  failwith "unimplemented"

(* increments the grade for `student` 
 * and returns the updated gradebook *)
let rec increment_grade gb student = 
  failwith "unimplemented"

```
